# Notes

1. Use path.resolve for the path to `build/` because webpack needs absolute
paths now
1. Use an npm script instead of the `./node_modules/.bin/...`
    - Point out that npm automatically uses node_modules first
1. Add build to gitignore
1. Webpack has a new module api - needs to be updated
